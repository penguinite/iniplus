# iniplus

An extended INI parser for Nim. Intended to be as performant as `std/parsecfg` whilst being nearly as flexible with data types as TOML.

## Status

The two most important things (arrays and tables) are missing but the rest is working. Helper functions for retrieving data and writing to configs are also missing.
